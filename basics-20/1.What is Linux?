### ðŸ“Œ **What is Linux?**  

#### **Definition**  
Linux is a free, open-source operating system (OS) that acts as a bridge between your computer hardware and the applications you use. It is based on the UNIX operating system and provides a stable, flexible, and secure environment for personal and professional computing.  

At its core, Linux includes:  
1. **Kernel**: The heart of the OS that manages hardware resources.  
2. **Shell**: The interface that interprets user commands.  
3. **Utilities**: Tools to perform various system-related tasks.  

#### **History of Linux**  
- **1983**: The Free Software Foundation (FSF) was founded by Richard Stallman to promote open-source software. This led to the creation of GNU, an open-source UNIX-like OS.  
- **1991**: Linus Torvalds, a Finnish computer science student, developed the Linux kernel as a hobby project and shared it online for free. His work combined with GNU tools resulted in a fully functional operating system.  
- **Today**: Linux powers everything from smartphones (Android) and servers to supercomputers and IoT devices.  

#### **Why is Linux Unique?**  
Linux is open-source, meaning:  
- Its code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute.  
- A vibrant community actively contributes to its improvement.  

#### **Popular Linux Distributions**  
Linux comes in many "flavors" called **distributions (distros)**. Each distro is tailored for specific use cases, such as desktop computing, servers, or cybersecurity. Some well-known distros include:  
- **Ubuntu**: Beginner-friendly and widely used for desktops and servers.  
- **Fedora**: Cutting-edge features and innovation.  
- **Debian**: Known for stability and security.  
- **CentOS/AlmaLinux**: Perfect for servers.  
- **Kali Linux**: Designed for penetration testing and security.  

#### **Where is Linux Used?**  
Linux is everywhere:  
1. **Servers**: Over 90% of the worldâ€™s servers run on Linux, including giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook.  
2. **Android Devices**: Your smartphone likely runs on a Linux-based OS.  
3. **Supercomputers**: All top 500 supercomputers run Linux.  
4. **IoT Devices**: Smart TVs, refrigerators, and even cars use Linux-based systems.  

#### **Key Features of Linux**  
- **Free**: No license costs.  
- **Secure**: Highly resistant to viruses and malware.  
- **Customizable**: Modify it to meet your exact needs.  
- **Lightweight**: Runs smoothly on older hardware.  
- **Community-Driven**: Continuous updates and support.
